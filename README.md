# Cross-Safe
Cross-Safe is a project for real-time pedestrian signal detection and recognition. More specifically, it is based on a deep learning recognition algorithm, enabling robust walking signal sign detection and signal recognition. 

A custom image library was built and developed to train, validate, and test our methodology on real traffic intersections, demonstrating the feasibility of Cross-Safe in providing safe guidance to the visually impaired at urban intersections.
